What was your motivation?

the motivation behind this project was to build out an interactive quiz that i can use to then build on to either build a questionaire using the new found knowledge of js.

What did you learn?

getting a grasp on the functions and how to call multiple functions within one such as starting the timer, but also showing the questions and learning how to then expand on that for future projects.
